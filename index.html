# Continuous Delivery on OpenShift

<hr />

## Building a functional build/deploy system at HealthPartners

---

# Philosophies

1. High availability for production
2. Secure credentials for all environments
3. Good default behavior
4. Continuous delivery â€“ on demand from the business perspective
5. Everything comes from source control
6. Keep things ephemeral, record externally

---

# Cluster Design

* Build tools run on bld1 cluster
* Applications have three environments (dev, uat, prod)
.center[![Clusters](/images/cluster-design.png)]

---

# Tools

* Jenkins
* Bitbucket and Gitlab (long story)
* Nexus and Artifactory (long story)
* Jira & HipChat
* Hashicorp Vault
* Fortify
* Sonarqube
* ServiceNow

---

# OpenShift Concepts

* `BuildConfig` object integrates with Jenkins using `openshift-sync` plugin
* Jenkins uses `openshift-login` plugin to delegate access
* Jenkins pod running in each OpenShift namespace
* Each team owns one or more namespaces
